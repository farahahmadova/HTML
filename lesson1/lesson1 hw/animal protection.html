    <h1 style="text-align:center">WHY SHOULD ANIMALS BE PROTECTED?</h1>
    <p>Animals should be protected because science increasingly demonstrates that animals are more sensitive, aware, and intelligent than has long been believed in places like the US. The knowledge that animals are very likely aware of the conditions in which they’re kept in places like factory farms, or the abuses they suffer during laboratory experiments, means that a change in practices is long overdue. 

        Animals also play a critical role in the ecosystems and biospheres that make life on Earth possible for humans. Protecting animals—as well as the oceans, forests, and grasslands they inhabit—will help safeguard the future for all species.Animal protection can be very effective, whether through grassroots advocacy, engaging with corporations to hold them accountable, or lobbying elected officials to enact protective legislation. The Humane League has secured many victories for animals over the years. Below are a few examples of how animal protection can be effective at reducing abuses for millions of living being.</p>
